Pypsy.optimization
==================

The internals of the :py:mod:`~Pypsy.optimization` module are a
quick-and-dirty implementation of conjugate gradient descent, that is used
in decomposing a :py:class:`Pypsy.signal.EDASignal` into its constituent
tonic and phasic components. These methods are used internally by the
:py:class:`~Pypsy.signal.EDASignal` class.
